![Based Tic-tac-toe](https://github.com/mianuddin/Based_Tic-tac-toe/raw/master/images/Logo.png)

## What is this?

* My final for Intro to Comp. Sci. (C++)
* A Based God themed Tic-tac-toe game.

## How it works.

The Tic-tac-toe grid will be represented using a two-dimensional array. "0" will denote an empty space, "1" a X, and "2" an O. I'll be using the CMU Graphics Library for the GUI.

## To-Do List

* Detect Function: Detects if someone has won or if the board is full.
* GUI
